            Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to make websites flexible and responsive to the user's needs and behaviors. There are many reasons for adopting a responsive design, and it is becoming the new standard for web development.
          </p>

            There are currently over 24,000 devices with a range of screen resolutions, and there will likely be more additions in the years to come. Due to the increasing number of devices, including smartphones, tablets and game consoles, it is infeasible to create websites that are compatible for every screen size. In order to address this issue, it is becoming essential for websites to automatically adjust to the userâ€™s devices. This is accomplished through adopting a grid-based layout, inserting flexible images, and using media queries, as stated in Ethan Marcotte's article, "Responsive Web Design".

            RWD however, is not only about adjusting screen resolutions and images, and search engine optimization is another important reason for using this approach. Since 2015, Google  reflects user friendliness and mobile optimization in their website rankings. With mobile users accounting for more than half of daily internet usage,  it is crucial that their experiences are pleasant and responsive. Statistics show that lack of RWD is also bad for business, for mobile users are less likely to purchase products, or return to websites that have little or no mobile optimization.

            RWD is a feasible solution for  creating responsive and user friendly websites for the the seemingly infinite number of devices with differing screen resolutions. It is also beneficial for business, as user friendly websites are more discoverable and frequently visited by users. Although it can be costly and time consuming to switch to a responsive website, it would seem that the benefits of RWD outweigh the drawbacks. After all, inclusivity and accessibility is what the internet is all about.
